          <p>Most people report an upward shift at the end of Sequence A, and a downward shift at the end of Sequence B.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>In fact, the two final tones of Sequence A are physically identical to the two final tones of Sequence B. Only the preceding melodies are different.</p>
          <p>Do not take our word for it: use the sliders above to listen only to the two final tones of Sequence A and Sequence B (without any note from the preceding melody). You will hear that they really are the same in both cases.</p>

        <p>We believe that the illusion reveals potent and ubiquitous contextual processing in audition, perhaps explaining why people are so good at dealing with complex natural auditory scenes.</p>
        <p>In a few words, everytime you hear two successive sounds (two phonemes, two musical notes), you need somehow to bind them over time to realise that e.g. pitch went up. In our examples, the final two tones presented a carefully-balanced situation: there were as many "up" transitions between successive frequencies than "down" transitions. What the context did was to bias you towards one possible binding between tones, the binding that minimizes the overall distance between tones (after all, real sounds do tend to evolve smoothly over time).</p>
        <p>This is only part of the story! For a lot of behavioral data, some brain imaging, and a computational model explaining why this is important for everyday sounds, see: 'Prior context in audition informs binding and shapes simple features', Nature Communications, by Claire Chambers, Sahar Akram, Vincent Adam, Claire Pelofi, Maneesh Sahani, Shihab Shamma, and Daniel Pressnitzer.</p>
        <p>This work was done in the LSP lab (CNRS &amp; Ecole normale supérieure), in collaboration with U. Maryland (USA) and the Gatsby Institute in London.</p>

      <h3>Wait, it did not really work for me...</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <p> The illusion was found to be highly robust, in a series of psychophysical and online experiments involving 150+ participants. But, interestingly, sometimes there were also strong biases towards one direction, peculiar to each listener and the acoustic details of each sound. Maybe the example above was heavily biased for your particular ears? <a href="http://audition.ens.fr/dp/illusion/more_examples.html" target="_blank">Try those instead.</a></p>
